WARNING: The YUMA Annotation Client Suite is not yet completed. The documentation
below is PRELIMINARY DEVELOPER DOC! And not yet suitable for end users!
Please contact rainer.simon@ait.ac.at for further details.

Requirements
------------
The YUMA Annotation Client Suite requires Java 1.6 and a Servlet container such as
Tomcat 6. All configuration parameters are located in the web.xml.

IMPORTANT: the YUMA Annotation Client Suite requires access to a running instance
of the YUMA Annotation Server!

Quick Start
-----------
Check out the YUMA Annotation Server project from 

http://github.com/yuma-annotation/server

Deploy the server on your Servlet container. Alternatively, the Annotation Server
project includes an embedded Jetty. Start the Server with the "StartAnnotationServer"
class located in /src/test/java/at/ait/dme/yuma/server/bootstrap. (Refer to the Server
documentation for further details).

Make sure all local path settings are correct in the Annotation Client Suite's 
web.xml. 

In Eclipse, you can launch the Client Suite application with the included 'Application.launch'
launch config.
