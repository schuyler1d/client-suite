The YUMA Media Annotation Client Suite
--------------------------------------

WARNING: The YUMA Annotation Client Suite is not yet completed. The documentation
below is PRELIMINARY DEVELOPER DOC! And not yet suitable for end users!
Please contact rainer.simon@ait.ac.at for further details.

TODOs
-----
- Re-enable NER in the annotation edit form.
- Re-enable 'Show on Google Maps' in YUMA Maps.
- There is a strange character encoding problem. (Try adding a a tag with an 
  international character -> works -> reload the page -> character is messed up.)
- Map drawing tools: 'place marker' feature!
- Image tool: nice-up the colorpicker!
- Image tool: the tool panel/colorpicker needs to be DETACHABLE (right now, when the
  user wants to draw on the lower edge of the image, the panel slips off the screen and
  is no longer reachable...)
- JSON/SVG parsing is now in Core module. Refactor this! Base JSON parsing
  needs to stay in Core. Media-specific parts + SVG parsing belong into
  appropriate media module.
- Split parsing/serializing functionality into two separate classes.
- Clean up the services mess in the enrichment packages.
- Clean up the map annotation tool packages. In particular, introduce a
  package-by-feature structure for the services - and clean up services mess
  in the .geo subpackage!
- Finish the example pages.
- Finish the landing page.
- Move Userguide pages to Wicket.
- Create developer doc pages.
- Make sure everything from annotate.jsp, index.html and test.html is moved over
  to Wicket and then delete those files.
- Integrate Christians Auth-Token decoding code.
- Geonames is CONSTANTLY down - create a DB-based solution with a local 
  Geonames dump.
- DBpedia lookup seems to have moved, changed endpoint, changed syntax (?)
  Investigate - and think about a solution based on a local dump as well!
- Controlled vocabulary tagging: see if this can be integrated. (Possibly makes
  sense to integrate this with the DBpedia dump? "YUMA Tag Server"? -> Look into 
  MOAT!)
- Last but not least: we need more & better unit tests. Possibly some Web
  tests, too. (Look into Wicket test tooling for this!)

Requirements
------------
The YUMA Annotation Client Suite requires Java 1.6 and a Servlet container such as
Tomcat 6. All configuration parameters are located in the web.xml.

IMPORTANT: the YUMA Annotation Client Suite requires access to a running instance
of the YUMA Annotation Server!

Quick Start
-----------
Check out the YUMA Annotation Server project from 

http://github.com/yuma-annotation/server

Deploy the server on your Servlet container. Alternatively, the Annotation Server
project includes an embedded Jetty. Start the Server with the "StartAnnotationServer"
class located in /src/test/java/at/ait/dme/yuma/server/bootstrap. (Refer to the Server
documentation for further details).

Make sure all local path settings are correct in the Annotation Client Suite's 
web.xml. 

In Eclipse, you can launch the Client Suite application with the included 'Application.launch'
launch config.
