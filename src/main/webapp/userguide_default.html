	<h2>Image Annotation User Guide</h2>	
	<p class="imageAnnotation-user-guide">
		Welcome to the Image Annotation Tool. This tool can be used to 
		create, update and delete annotations for the provided image. 
		Further each annotation can be associated with a particular 
		part of the image, i.e. you can define a rectangular, elliptical-shaped, 
		and polygon-shaped area on the image and attach your annotation to 
		this area.
	</p>

	<h3>Creating Annotations</h3>
	<p class="imageAnnotation-user-guide">
		As a registered user you can create your own annotations, modify
		and delete them. You may reply to an existing annotation as well.
		Therefore you can see two options in the figure below: <i>"Annotate image"</i>
		and <i>"Annotate fragment"</i>. In the first case a form for entering the title
		and the description of the annotation will be presented. You may also 
		choose whether to create a public or private annotation. Public annotations
		are visible to everyone whereas private annotations are visible only to you.
		<br /><br />
		In the second case you annotate a fragment of the image, so an annotation figure 
		with default properties is drawn to select the fragment. In the example below it
		is a brown circle. You can now move the figure by dragging-and-dropping it or resize 
		it by dragging-and-dropping the dragging points. The shape of the figure,
		stroke size and stroke color can all be changed using the corresponding
		radio buttons or the color picker respectively. If you choose to create a polygon-shaped
		area you will need to click on the image for every point of the polygon. The points will
		be connected with lines as you click. Place the last point near the first point to close
		the polygon. If you decide to draw a freehand shape you will need to click once to start the
		draw mode and then move the mouse. Click again when you are done.
		<br /><br />
		You can further use the <img src="images/plus.png" /> and <img src="images/minus.png" />
		symbols on the image or your mousewheel to zoom in and out. The image can be dragged to 
		navigate to a different area. When finished, just click <i>"Save"</i> to save the new 
		annotation or <i>"Cancel"</i> to discard your changes.
	</p>

	<h3>Replying to an annotation</h3>
	<p class="imageAnnotation-user-guide">
		In addition to adding new annotations you can also reply to
		an existing annotation with another annotation. To do so, click on
		<i>"Reply"</i> or <i>"Reply with fragment"</i> to add a textual or a graphical
		annotation respectively. The further process for adding the annotation
		is the same as described above.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Modifying Annotations</h3>
	<p class="imageAnnotation-user-guide">
		Modifying an annotation is very similar to creating a new annotation. 
		You must click the <i>"Edit"</i> button next to an annotation in
		the annotation list. Again, depending on whether you are modifying an
		annotation on the whole content item or only on a part of the image,
		either a form containing title and description or the annotation figure
		with the input window with the values already filled in is presented to
		you. You may now change any values and move or resize the figure. When
		you have finished, click <i>"Save"</i> to save the changes or <i>"Cancel"</i> 
		to discard the changes. Please note that you can only update annotations
		that you have created and only if no replies have been made yet.		
	</p>

	<h3>Deleting Annotations</h3>
	<p class="imageAnnotation-user-guide">
		Any annotation can be deleted simply by clicking the corresponding <i>"Delete"</i> 
		button in the annotation list. Deletion is only allowed to the original 
		author of the annotation. Please note that it is not possible to delete
		annotations other users have already replied to.
