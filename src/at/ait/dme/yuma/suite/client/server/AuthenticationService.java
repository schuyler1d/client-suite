/**
 * interface to a prototypical authentication service.
 * 
 * background: the image annotation service should be capable of being integrated 
 * into portals. therefore, authentication and authorization should be handled by the 
 * corresponding portal. to pass user credentials to the image annotation service, which
 * may also be hosted by a different provider, a SSO solution plus using OpenIDs would fit
 * best. Within TELplus such a infrastructure is far out of scope. That is why we decided to
 * exchange a secure token that holds the user information.
